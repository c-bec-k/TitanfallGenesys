# Welcome to the Militia

Humanity lives in the deepest reaches of explored space in a vast region known as The Frontier. It contains many well-known and inhabited solar systems, but many more worlds remain uncharted. Most people will never travel this far away from normal civilization, but for pioneers, explorers, mercenaries, outlaws, and soldiers—the Frontier offers both adventure and opportunity.

The Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) originally funded many expeditions to the Frontier, promising veterans of their military campaigns in the "Core Systems"—the region of space containing the IMC's inhabited worlds including Earth—free land and other benefits in return for starting up businesses and colonies on the Frontier. Eventually, the IMC withdrew this support, leaving the colonists stranded without outside assistance for several decades.

Over time, life continued on the Frontier largely independent from the Core Systems. However, when the IMC returned several decades later to claim eminent domain over the Frontier's land, people and resources, the people of the Frontier united as the Frontier Militia, utilizing guerrilla and terrorist actions to further their cause.

This is where you come in. You grew up in the Frontier, it is your home. Now the IMC is back and claiming everything you worked your entire life for is theirs. It isn't. You know that; now they need to learn it. Welcome to the Titan War.

## Using This Document

This document requires the Genesys Core Rulebook to play. The rules and other additions in this document build upon those found in the Core Rulebook, but the core rules are not reprinted here.

While not required, Shadow of the Beanstalk is a good Science Fiction setting that has archetypes, equipment and other things that won't go amiss in the Titanfall world. Especially the Favor economy! Also, the Expanded Player's Guide has rules for creating vehicles. This supplement concentrates on the pilots and the Titans they control and therefore there are no space ship or tank stats to be found. With the EPG you can easily use the examples provided or make your own!
