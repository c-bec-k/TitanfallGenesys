# Creating Characters

## Archetypes

All CRB archetypes, plus:

* Athlete
* Cyborg (SotB)
* Opportunist (trickster from EPG)
* Maybe others from the EPG

## Careers

There are many careers available on the frontier, but not all of them lend themselves to making for successful members of the militia.

The following careers are available, with options available upon GM approval.

### Ace

An Ace is the master of all things that fly or drive. They get you from Point A to Point B in once piece, and then cover your ass while you're there.

An Ace counts the following skills as career skills:  **Astrocartography**, **Cool**, **Drive**, **Gunnery**, **Mechanics**, **Perception**, **Piloting (Aerospace)**, **Ranged (light)**.

### Leader

The Leader focuses on leading and directing their fellows, as well as interacting with others. Leaders have a knack for taking charge and overseeing a situation, but their methods of leadership can vary wildly. A Leader can be a kind and caring boss, a soft-spoken politician, or a military  commander who believes in absolute discipline.

The Leader counts the following skills as career skills: **Charm**, **Coercion**, **Cool**, **Discipline**, **Leadership**, **Melee**, **Negotiation**, and **Perception**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Leader may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Medic

Some Medics come from prestigious backgrounds like doctors or nurses while others learn from experience. In either case, Medics are highly prized for their ability to save lives and keep the militia in fighting form.

The Medic counts the following skills as career skills: **Cool**, **Discipline**, **Knowledge (Frontier)**, **Medicine**, **Ranged (Light)**, **Resilience**, **Survival**, and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Medic may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Ranger

The Ranger comes from a background of hunting in the wilds, far from civilization. In the militia, a Ranger makes an excellent scout.

The Ranger counts the following skills as career skills: **Athletics**, **Coordination**, **Deception**, **Melee**, **Perception**, **Ranged (Heavy)**, **Stealth**, and **Survival**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Ranger may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Socialite

Socialites are the consummate social butterflies, at ease in any interactions involving talking to someone else. Whether a rich debutante in the highest circles of society or a good-natured bartender who knows everyone’s name, a Socialite can get along with anyone and every-one. More importantly, they always know how to get the best out of any social interaction.

The Socialite counts the following skills as career skills: **Charm**, **Cool**, **Deception**, **Knowledge (Education)**, **Negotiation**, **Perception**, **Streetwise**, and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Socialite may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Smuggler

On the Frontier, resources are rarely distributed fairly or equitably. Some people use the services of Smugglers to redistribute resources in their favor, using both guile and technical skill. With their ability to move goods under the radar, they are indispensable in the fight against the IMC.

A Smuggler counts the following skills as career skills: **Cool**, **Deception**, **Knowledge (Underworld)**, **Negotiation**, **Pilot (Aerospace)**, **Ranged (Light)**, **Skulduggery**, **Streetwise**.

### Soldier

Soldiers are warriors through and through. At home on the battlefield, they know everything there is to know about surviving the horrors of combat—and making sure the opposition doesn’t.

The Soldier counts the following skills as career skills: **Athletics**, **Brawl**, **Coercion**, **Gunnery**, **Perception**, **Ranged (Heavy)**, **Survival**, and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Soldier may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Technician

A Technician is an expert of all things mechanical and technical. They excel when something doesn't work and should or when something is working and they don't want it to.

The Technician counts the following skills as career skills: **Computers**, **Discipline**, **Knowledge (Education)**, **Mechanics**, **Perception**, **Pilot (Aerospace)**, **Streetwise**, and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Hacker may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

## Skills

### Piloting

#### Aerospace (Agility)

This skill covers the use and operation of any vehicle that flies through an atmosphere or in space. This takes the place of the Pilot skill from the *Genesys* Core Rule Book (found on pages 62–63).

#### Titan (Cunning)

This skill covers the intricacies of piloting the massive war machines called Titans. Not only do you need to have quick reflexes to pilot them, but you need to know how the Titan moves compared to that of more conventional vehicles.

##### Your character should use this skill if…

* Your character is using their Titan to punch a target.
* Your character maneuvers a Titan through a dense city block while under fire.
* Your character is trying to dock a badly-damaged Titan.

##### Your character should not use this skill if…

* Your character is flying a shuttle craft. That falls under the Pilot (Aerospace) skill.
* Your character wants to fix a Titan. That uses the Mechanics skill.
* Your character is walking the Titan from Point A to Point B without any fear of failure.
