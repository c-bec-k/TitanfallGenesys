# Character Creation

Most inhabitants of the Frontier just want to live their lives. Wake up, get a cup of coffee, go to work, do their job, come home, eat dinner and go to bed. And then wake up in the morning to repeat the process.

Yesterday, that could have described you. Tomorrow, you may wish it still did.

In Titanfall: Genesys, you play a mostly-normal person living in the Frontier who has gotten sick and tired of the IMC thinking they own you. You are not property and you're ready to make sure they know it, too!

Maybe you witnessed something you can't unsee. Maybe you were treated like dirt one too many times. Maybe someone you love just disappeared. Whatever the reason, you can no longer hide your head in the sand. You have to fight back!

You are now a member of the Frontier Militia; in name only or perhaps you sought out your local Militia chapter and 'enlisted'. Either way, the IMC will pay and you are the one to make sure they do!

## Creating Your Character

This document supplements the *Genesys* Core Rulebook to play games set in Respawn's Titanfall universe. While this document is geared towards the items and Titans seen in the first installment of the series, it wouldn't be too much work to use the *Expanded Player's Guide* to fashion additional Titans based off of the second game in the series.

In this chapter, you will find all of the rules and information that, combined with the character creation rules that start on page 32 of the Genesys Core Rulebook, you’ll need to build a character for this game. To build a character, you’ll follow the steps outlined here (which mirror the steps found in the Genesys Core Rulebook).

### Steps for Creating Characters

Titanfall: Genesys uses the system set out in the Core Rulebook to create characters. You follow the seven steps as laid out in the Genesys Core Rulebook, with the exceptions noted below (for example, Step 2 has new archetypes and you have more cash to spend on equipment in Step 7).

#### Step 1: Determine Background

Who is your character? Where do they come from? Why have they joined the Militia? What did they do before enlisting? What was the last straw that broke the camel's back and made them want to fight?

A solid idea for your character's background can go a long way towards helping you decide on the mechanical bits for your character. It doesn't have to be a long background, just enough to get an idea of who they are and what they want.

If you want to write out your character's background, try to keep it to no more than 4 paragraphs and under 300 words total.

#### Step 2: Select a Character Archetype

Once you have a firm idea of who your character is, the next step is to choose an archetype. You are free to choose any of the four human archetypes listed in the Genesys Core Rulebook starting on page 36 or choose one of the three new archetypes introduced later in this chapter. Note, however, that each of the Core Rulebook archetypes have a few changes made to them, as discussed in the Archetype section, below.

All CRB archetypes, plus:

* Athlete
* Cyborg (SotB)
* Opportunist (trickster from EPG)
* Maybe others from the EPG

#### Step 3: Choose a Career

Now that you have a background and an archetype decided on, you can choose your character's career.

There are a number of careers available in Titanfall: Genesys. And while many of them are from the Genesys Core Rulebook, those that are have been re-printed here because many have skill substitutions based on the setting. It is easier to have the career with the correct skills listed instead of having to remember which skills are and are not available in this setting.

#### Step 4: Invest Experience Points

Now that you have the basic building blocks of your character in place, it is time for you to customize them by spending starting experience points. Each archetype gives you a specific amount of experience points you can spend, and there is a table on page 45 of the Genesys Core Rulebook that explains how you can spend it.

Two things to note when spending your starting experience:

* It is suggested on the bottom of page 36 of the Core Rulebook that you spend all but 25–35 experience on characteristics, since this is going to be the last time (outside of the Dedicated talent) you'll be able to modify those numbers
* As a Titanfall: Genesys GM, if you want your players to be veterans of the Titan War instead of new recruits—or if you want them to be new recruits with a few battles under their belts—it is recommended to use the Experienced Characters rule. This rule can be found in the sidebar on page 44 of the Genesys Core Rulebook.

#### Step 5: Determine Derived Attributes

After you have spent all of your starting experience it is time to work out your characters derived attributes. The derived attributes include wound threshold, strain threshold, defense, and soak value.

#### Step 6: Determine Motivations

Perhaps the most important aspect of your character is their Motivation. This is going to help you figure out how your character responds to any given situation, how they deal with dangers and threats, and what drives them to succeed.

How Motivations work and lists of Motivations to choose from can be found on page 46 of the Genesys Core Rulebook.

If you have access to, and your Game Master is allowing, Shadow of the Beanstalk you may also chose a starting Favor, as described on page 53 of that book.

#### Step 7: Choose Gear, Appearance, and Personality

Now is the time you determine the descriptive details of your character and spend your starting credits. While your character's appearance and personality are completely up to you, page 54 of the Genesys Core Rulebook has some helpful guidelines.

In addition to what your character looks and acts like, you also get to spend your starting credits. For Titanfall: Genesys, your character starts with 1,000 credits to purchase starting gear. You may not start with any restricted gear—those listed with `(R)` next to the price. GMs, if you are using the Experienced Characters optional rule, you may give your players an additional 500 credits (for a total of 1,500 starting credits) and one item may be restricted.

## New Character Archetypes

As mentioned previously, all characters in Titanfall: Genesys are human and thus all the human archetypes in the Genesys Core Rulebook on pages 36–39 are available to choose from. In addition, you will find three new archetypes presented here, the athlete, the cyborg, and the opportunist. Please note that the cyborg presented here is slightly different than the cyborg archetype found in Shadow of the Beanstalk.

Lastly, there are a few changes to the human archetypes found in the Core Rulebook.

* For the average human, reduce starting experience to 100 and add the following to Ready for Anything: "You may only do this if the Game Master has more Story Points in their pool."
* For the laborer, increase starting experience to 105
* For the intellectual, reduce starting strain threshold to 11 + Willpower and reduce starting experience to 95
* For the aristocrat, reduce starting experience to 95

### The Athlete

Use the gymnast from AS, swap Ag and Will.

## New Careers

While the list of careers in the Genesys Core Rulebook are quite extensive and very usable with Titanfall, the fact that there are several skill substitutions makes referencing them a bit more work than they otherwise could be.

For that reason, the careers from the Core Rulebook will be re-printed here with the appropriate skills listed and a bit of lore about how the career fits into the Titanfall world.

### Ace

An Ace is the master of all things that fly or drive. They get you from Point A to Point B in once piece, and then cover your ass while you're there.

An Ace counts the following skills as career skills: **Astrocartography**, **Cool**, **Drive**, **Gunnery**, **Mechanics**, **Perception**, **Piloting (Aerospace)**, **Ranged (light)**. Before spending experience during character creation, an Ace may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Leader

The Leader focuses on leading and directing their fellows, as well as interacting with others. Leaders have a knack for taking charge and overseeing a situation, but their methods of leadership can vary wildly. A Leader can be a kind and caring boss, a soft-spoken politician, or a military commander who believes in absolute discipline.

The Leader counts the following skills as career skills: **Charm**, **Coercion**, **Cool**, **Discipline**, **Leadership**, **Melee**, **Negotiation**, and **Perception**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Leader may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Medic

Some Medics come from prestigious backgrounds like doctors or nurses while others learn from experience. In either case, Medics are highly prized for their ability to save lives and keep the militia in fighting form.

The Medic counts the following skills as career skills: **Cool**, **Discipline**, **Knowledge**, **Medicine**, **Ranged (Light)**, **Resilience**, **Survival**, and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Medic may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Ranger

The Ranger comes from a background of hunting in the wilds, far from civilization. In the militia, a Ranger makes an excellent scout.

The Ranger counts the following skills as career skills: **Athletics**, **Coordination**, **Deception**, **Melee**, **Perception**, **Ranged (Heavy)**, **Stealth**, and **Survival**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Ranger may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Socialite

Socialites are the consummate social butterflies, at ease in any interactions involving talking to someone else. Whether a rich debutante in the highest circles of society or a good-natured bartender who knows everyone’s name, a Socialite can get along with anyone and every-one. More importantly, they always know how to get the best out of any social interaction.

The Socialite counts the following skills as career skills: **Charm**, **Cool**, **Deception**, **Knowledge**, **Negotiation**, **Perception**, **Streetwise**, and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Socialite may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Smuggler

On the Frontier, resources are rarely distributed fairly or equitably. Some people use the services of Smugglers to redistribute resources in their favor, using both guile and technical skill. With their ability to move goods under the radar, they are indispensable in the fight against the IMC.

A Smuggler counts the following skills as career skills: **Cool**, **Deception**, **Knowledge**, **Negotiation**, **Pilot (Aerospace)**, **Ranged (Light)**, **Skulduggery**, **Streetwise**.

### Soldier

Soldiers are warriors through and through. At home on the battlefield, they know everything there is to know about surviving the horrors of combat—and making sure the opposition doesn’t.

The Soldier counts the following skills as career skills: **Athletics**, **Brawl**, **Coercion**, **Gunnery**, **Perception**, **Ranged (Heavy)**, **Survival**, and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Soldier may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

### Technician

A Technician is an expert of all things mechanical and technical. They excel when something doesn't work and should or when something is working and they don't want it to.

The Technician counts the following skills as career skills: **Astrocartography**, **Computers**, **Discipline**, **Mechanics**, **Perception**, **Pilot (Aerospace)**, **Streetwise**, and **Vigilance**. Before spending experience during character creation, a Hacker may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

## New Skills

Titanfall: Genesys introduces two new skills to the game

### Piloting

#### Aerospace (Agility)

This skill covers the use and operation of any vehicle that flies through an atmosphere or in space. This takes the place of the Pilot skill from the *Genesys* Core Rule Book (found on pages 62–63).

#### Titan (Cunning)

This skill covers the intricacies of piloting the massive war machines called Titans. Not only do you need to have quick reflexes to pilot them, but you need to know how the Titan moves compared to that of more conventional vehicles.

##### Your character should use this skill if…

* Your character is using their Titan to punch a target.
* Your character maneuvers a Titan through a dense city block while under fire.
* Your character is trying to dock a badly-damaged Titan.

##### Your character should not use this skill if…

* Your character is flying a shuttle craft. That falls under the Pilot (Aerospace) skill.
* Your character wants to fix a Titan. That uses the Mechanics skill.
* Your character is walking the Titan from Point A to Point B without any fear of failure.

## New Talents

### Tier 1

#### Precision

**Tier:** 1 \
**Activation:** Active (Incidental) \
