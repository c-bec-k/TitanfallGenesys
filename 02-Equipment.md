# Equipment

## New Qualities

The following qualities are available to certain weapons in _Titanfall: Genesys_

### Arc

Arc weapons specialize in taking down energy shields with a massive jolt of arc energy. An arc weapon can negate Defense granted by energy shields by spending [AD][ad] (instead of the usual [AD][ad][AD]).

### Reduced Magazine

Weapons with a Reduced Magazine either doesn't hold much ammo or it goes through ammo at an alarming rate. Either way, this weapon can run out of ammo by spending [TH][TH][TH] (in addition to the normal [DE]).

## Weapons

### Melee Weapons

Not all weapons are firearms. Sometimes you need to get up close and personal. For that, there are several melee weapons available to soldiers.

#### Brass Knuckles

Brass knuckles are very simple weapons: chunks of brass designed to slip over your fingers and add power to your punches. Many ruffians and roughnecks use brass knuckles as a tool of intimidation but they are rarely seen on the battlefield. But when you're fighting against the IMC, you'll use any advantage you can get!

- **Brass Knuckles:** Brawl; Damage +1; Cit 4; Range (Engaged); Disorient 2, Knockdown, Stun Damage (optional); 75 credits; Enc 1; HP 0

#### Combat Knife

The ubiquitous knife is easy to use, lightweight and one of the first weapons most soldiers learn to fight with. While they are used as a close-in weapon, more often than not they are used for survival purposes instead of killing people. Cutting down branches for a fire, carving makeshift weapons, and even a cooking/eating tool, it is found on most worlds in the Frontier.

- **Combat Knife:** Melee; Damage +1; Crit 3; Range (Engaged); Accurate 1; 150 credits; Enc 1; HP 1

#### Longblade

Longblades have been coming back into vogue since the first sight of a Titan carrying a sword of its own. Deadly and silent, this weapon is the preferred weapon of scouts and assassins alike.

- **Longblade:** Melee; Damage +2; Crit 2; Range (Engaged); Defensive 1; 225 credits; Enc 2; HP 1

#### Stun Baton

A favorite of those who wish to take a target alive, the stun baton is a baton with a small power cell that delivers a shock to those struck by it. As it is a simple enough weapon to manufacture there are a multitude of variants that range from a metal stick with a rubber handle to a composite alloy that extends and collapses for easy of storage.

- **Stun Baton:** Melee; Damage +2; Crit 5; Range (Engaged); Disorient 3, Stun Damage; 125 credits; Enc 1; HP 1

### Sidearms

Soldiers who are not in the front lines, like medics, mechanics, armor drivers, and the like have a sidearm as their main weapon, just in case. Others who are expected to be in the thick of things carry them as backup weapons.

#### Autopistol

Autopistols have the high rate of fire of assault rifles and carbines but use pistol ammo. This gives them a shorter range and less impact on the target, but they're cheaper to manufacture. Indeed, the use of pistol ammo allows them to be cheaply rearmed, as well.

**Models Include:** RE-45

- **Autopistol:** Ranged (Light); Damage 5; Crit 3; Range (Short); Auto-Fire, Reduced Magazine; 400(R) credits; Enc 2; HP 1

#### Heavy Revolver

Heavy revolvers are popular with those who enjoy a big and intimidating weapon. Sidearms of this size are near impossible to conceal and are a perfect weapon for close in, vicious firefights.

**Models Include:** B3 Wingman

- **Heavy Revolver:** Ranged (Light); Damage 7; Crit 3; Range (Medium); Inaccurate 1; Limited Ammo 4; 325 credits; Enc 2; HP 2

#### Light Pistol

Lightweight and easy to use due to low recoil, it doesn't have the same stopping power of its heavier brethren. The light materials and smaller size, however, makes it perfect for hiding on one's person and because of this it is a favorite of undercover operatives across the frontier. Anyone searching your character adds [S] to any Perception checks they make to find a light pistol.

- **Light Pistol:** Ranged (Light); Damage 5; Crit 4; Range (Short); 200 credits; Enc 1; HP 0

#### Pistol

The ubiquitous pistol has seen very little change in the centuries since its introduction. This workhorse of the galaxy has seen use since the dawn of recorded history.

**Models Include:** Hammond P2011, Hammond P2016, Hammond P2020

- **Pistol:** Ranged (Light); Damage 6; Crit 3; Range (Medium); 400 credits; Enc 1; HP 1

#### Smart Pistol

Smart pistols are a fairly new addition to the battlefield. Using state-of-the-art guidance systems, it fires specialized ammo that has limited tracking capability. Not a fire-and-forget weapon like guided missiles but also not as complex or expensive. When your character performs the aim maneuver, instead of adding [B] you instead add [SU] to the results of the combat check. Each extra magazine for a smart pistol costs 100 credits.

**Models Include:** Smart Pistol mk5, Smart Pistol mk6

- **Smart Pistol:** Ranged (Light); Damage 5; Crit 3; Range (Medium); Reduced Magazine; 500(R) credits; Enc 1; HP 1

### Long-arms

#### Anti-Materiel Rifles

These rifles take the idea of the sniper rifle and crank it up to 11. Anti-material rifles are designed to take out lightly-armored vehicles. If they are ever used against infantry, the target doesn't stand a chance.

**Models Include:** Kraber Armor Penetrating .50-cal Sniper Rifle

- **Anti-Materiel Rifle:** Ranged (Heavy); Damage 12; Crit 2; Range (Extreme); Cumbersome 3, Pierce 5, Slow-Firing 1; 2,300(R) credits; Enc 5; HP 2

#### Assault Rifle

Assault rifles are the mainstay of modern militaries. Lightweight, good range, and able to fire numerous medium-calibre rounds with one pull of the trigger. These weapons are extremely deadly in the right hands.

**Models Include:** R-201 Assault Rife, M1A3 Hemlok, V-47 Flatline

- **Assault Rifle:** Ranged (Heavy); Damage 8; Crit 3; Range (Long); Auto-Fire; 1,200(R) credits; Enc 4; HP 2

#### Battle Rifle

A battle rifle is a weapon that chambers a large calibre round, as opposed to the smaller calibre rounds of pistols and SMGs or the medium calibre rounds of assault rifles and carbines. While most are capable of fully-automatic fire the recoil makes it very prohibitive to do so. Therefore, most battle rifles are single-shot weapons.

**Models Include:** G2A4 Battle Rifle, G2A5 Battle Rifle, G7 Scout

- **Battle Rifle:** Ranged (Heavy); Damage 9; Crit 3; Range (Long); Accurate 1, Reduced Magazine; 900 credits; Enc 4; HP 2

#### Carbine

Carbines are a close cousin to the assault rifle. Whereas assault rifles have a longer range, carbines are designed for closer engagements.

**Models Include:** R-101 Compact Carbine, R-301 Carbine

- **Carbine:** Ranged (Heavy); Damage 7; Crit 3; Range (Medium); Accurate 1, Auto-Fire; 800 credits; Enc 3; HP 1

#### Shotgun

Shotguns are short-ranged weapons that fire a cartridge of 'shot': a bunch of tiny balls of a variety of materials. The end result is a lot of holes in your target. Historically used for sport shooting and hunting, the ready availability of them makes it a common sight in the hands of the Militia.

**Models Include:** EVA-8, M1901 Mastiff

- **Shotgun:** Ranged (Heavy); Damage 8; Crit 3; Range (Short); Accurate 1, Knockdown, Vicious 2; 1,000 credits; Enc 3; HP 2

#### Sniper Rifle

A sniper rifle is, in essence, a battle rifle designed for extreme accuracy at range. The elusive "one shot, one kill" weapon that is the bane of infantry everywhere. While effective at long range, it does take time to line up a shot, which makes it less than ideal in close-in fighting.

**Models Include:** D-101 Longbow Designated Marksman Rifle, D-2 Double Take

- **Sniper Rifle:** Ranged (Heavy); Damage 10; Crit 2; Range (Extreme); Accurate 2, Limited Ammo 3, Pierce 2, Prepare 1; 1,800(R) credits; Enc 4; HP 2

#### Submachine Guns

Submachine guns, or SMGs for short, are a compromise between auto-pistols and carbines. not as accurate as a carbine but a longer range than an autopistol, these weapon still use the smaller pistol-calibre ammo. Even though these weapons are designed to be used two-handed, it is possible to fire it with just one. If your character uses Ranged (Light) instead of Ranged (Heavy) increase the difficulty of the combat check by 1.

**Models Include:** Alternator, CAR (Combat Advanced Round Submachine Gun), R-97, R-99, Volt

- **SMG:** Ranged (Heavy); Damage 6; Crit 3; Range (Medium); Auto-Fire; 700(R) credits; Enc 3; HP 2

### Fire Support and Anti-Titan Weapons

When the enemy comes at you in giant robots bristling with guns, most people run away. The Frontier Militia, however, charges headlong at the Titans with weapons specifically designed to destroy them.

#### Anti-Titan Warheads

The latest in fire-and-forget anti-armor weapons, anti-titan missiles are man-portable weapons that lock onto any large vehicle–not just Titans. It does require some time to acquire the lock, however, so they are best used when behind cover and at range. Note that the Guided quality only applies against vehicular targets. Extra ammo for this weapon costs 3,000(R) credits.

There are also unguided anti-Titan rockets. Due to the dumb-fire nature of these weapons, however, they have been miniaturized and fielded in a rapid-fire weapon.

**Models Include:** Archer Heavy Rocket, Sidewinder AT-SMR

- **Anti-titan missile:** Gunnery; Damage 20; Crit 3; Range (Extreme); Blast 10, Breach 2, Cumbersome 3, Guided 3, Limited Ammo 1, Prepare 1; 7,000(R) credits; Enc 8; HP 4

- **Anti-Titan Mini Rocket Launcher:** Gunnery; Damage 18; Crit 2; Range(Medium); Auto-fire, Breach 1, Cumbersome 2, Inaccurate 1, Limited Ammo 3, Vicious 1; 4,275(R); Enc 6; HP 3

#### Directed Energy Weapon

These weapons are large-scale lasers that direct a beam of energy in order to cause extreme damage to a target. The intensity of the energy beam means that it can punch through even the thickest armor and cause some serious damage to any system unlucky enough to be struck. But the focused nature of the beam means it doesn't cause as grievous of damage as other, less precise weapons.

**Models Include:** Charge rifle

- **Directed Energy Weapon:** Gunnery; Damage 9; Crit 2; Range (Extreme); Accurate 1, Breach 2, Cumbersome 2, Slow-Firing 1, Vicious 2; 3,425(R) credits; Enc 7; HP 3

#### Grenade Launcher

These weapons are designed to fire specially-designed grenade ordinance at longer ranges than one can throw them. Because of the aerodynamics required to be shot at long ranges, you use any grenade, but special rounds designed specifically for this weapon.

There is a special anti-Titan grenade launcher that fires magnetic grenades designed to stick to armored targets to aim a shaped-charge at the vital internal components. These 'mag' launchers are a different weapon than the anti-infantry variants.

**Models Include:** EPG-1, EM-4 Cold War, R-6P Softball, MGL

- **Grenade Launcher:** Gunnery; Damage 8; Crit 4; Range (Long); Blast 6, Inaccurate 2, Limited Ammo 5; 800(R) credits; Enc 5; HP 2

- **Mag Launcher:** Gunnery; Damage 12; Crit 3; Range (Long); Accurate 2, Breach 2; 3,450(R) credits; Enc 6; HP 2

#### Light Machine Gun

Light machine guns are the heaviest man-portable squad automatic weapons. While heavy, these weapons can mow down infantry if used by anyone with even a modicum of skill. Because of their lethality, however, they are favorite targets on the battlefield.

**Models Include:** L-STAR, M600 Spitfire, X-55 Devotion

- **Light Machine Gun:** Gunnery; Damage 10; Crit 3; Range (Long); Auto-fire, Cumbersome 2, Pierce 2, Vicious 2; 2,000(R) credits; Enc 6; HP3

### Explosives and Ordinance

Sometimes guns just aren't enough. When you need to clear a room or flush someone out of cover you turn to grenades to get the job done.

#### Arc Grenade

The Arc Grenade is a grenade type employed by infantry of the IMC and Militia. When activated, the Arc Grenade explodes in a blast of Arc energy capable of short circuiting and dealing heavy damage to robotic units and equipment such as Titans, Spectres, Stalkers, HUDs and optical equipment found within the helmet of a Pilot and Reapers.

- **Arc Grenade:** Ranged (Light); Damage 5; Crit 4; Range (Short); Arc, Blast 4, Disorient 2, Limited Ammo 1, Stun Damage; 60 credits; Enc 1; HP 0

#### Firestar

The firestar is an incendiary throwing star that creates thermite on impact. It will stick to surfaces and enemies alike.

- **Firestar:** Ranged (Light); Damage 8; Crit 3; Range (Short); Burn 1, Limited Ammo 1; 100(R) credits; Enc 1; HP 0

#### Frag Grenade

These grenades are a small explosive core surrounding a fragile shell of ceramic and other materials that fragment easily to create a cloud of deadly shrapnel in the blast radius.

- **Frag Grenade:** Ranged (Light); Damage 7; Crit 3; Range (Short); Blast 7, Limited Ammo 1, Vicious 1; 80(R) credits; Enc 1; HP 0

## Armour

When someone says the word "armor" most people think of the tactical vests and helmets of a heavily armed police force or the fully enclosed carapace armor of a Titan pilot with a jump pack the truth is less romantic.

Most Frontier Militia get by with heavy coats, reinforced clothing or re-purposed police surplus.

### Armored Carapace

Armored carapace completely covers the wearer from head to toe and with the right attachments can be environmentally sealed. The carapace has a rigid outer shell that deflects or blocks incoming attacks. It is also designed to be extremely customizable, with one more hard point than a comparable size armour would otherwise have.

- **Armored carapace:** Defense 1; Soak +2; Enc 4; HP 3; 850(R) credits

### Cloaking Device

Personal cloaking devices blur the outline of the wearer, making it extremely hard to see them. While active, you may hide even when in plain sight.

Someone trying to spot your character upgrades the difficulty of their check once if your character is wearing a cloaking device.

- **Cloaking Device:** Defense 2; Soak +0; Enc 2; HP 1; 580(R) credits

### Heavy Clothing

This type of armor is not armor at all, but rather well-made clothes that provide the most basic protection against scrapes, bumps, and bruises. It includes things like biker leathers, military jumpsuits, and heavy-duty overalls.

- **Heavy Clothing:** Defense 0; Soak +1; Enc 1; HP 0; 50 currency

### Light Body Armor

A catch-all term for any armor that is not military-grade, such as armored vests and flak jackets. It provides a modicum of protection against most threats one would find on a battlefield.

- **Light Body Armor:** Defense 0; Soak +2; Enc 2; HP 1; 500 credits

## Gear

While it's nice to think that all you need to take on the IMC is a gun and some armor, Militia members have a plethora of other items at their disposal. These items not only make it easier to fight the IMC but to make their day-to-day lives just that little bit less miserable.

### Genesys Gear for the Titanfall Setting

In addition to the new gear listed below, the following gear from the Genesys Core Rulebook is also available.

- Backpack, page 94
- Painkiller, page 94
- Rope, page 94
- First aid kit, page 162
- Extra clip, page 168
- Portable medkit, page 169
- Cybernetics, page 177

### Combat Harness

A combat harness is a system used by soldiers to carry necessary equipment on their persons in easily accessible pouches. They are commonly made of hard-wearing reinforced textiles, and often with removable armor plates.

A combat harness increases a wearer's encumbrance threshold by 2.

### Comm-Bead

This communications device fits into a sentient's ear (or other auditory orifice) and allows them to communicate with friends and allies within 100 kilometers. If the comm-bead can tie into a planetary communications network (the kind that any civilized planet has), then it can communicate with anyone on the same planet.

An encrypted version of the comm-bead is also available. Any attempt to hack into the encrypted communication is upgraded twice.

### Jump Kit

Jump Kits provide a brief burst of thrust that is used to leap to higher locations. They also have a function that adjusts the deceleration on potentially fatal descents to safe levels, allowing Pilots to fall from great heights without injury.

When armed with a jump kit, upgrade all Athletics checks to climb and jump once and ignore difficult terrain as long as you can bypass it via a nearby wall or other outcropping. In addition, reduce the overall distance fallen by one range band.

### Night Optics

These goggles allows the wearer to see in the dark. When wearing night optics, your character removes up to [S][S] added to their checks due to darkness.

### Panacea

This liquid cocktail of adrenaline and various pharmaceutical drugs is used to temporarily enhance awareness and promote localized healing. The panacea is stored in a one-use syringe that is quickly injected to the subject.

When making a Medicine check, your character may use a panacea to add automatic [SU][AD] to the results. The panacea is consumed when used.

### Pulse Blade

A pulse blade can be thrown and provides a brief sonar pulse that can detect enemies even through walls.

As a maneuver, a character may make throw a pulse blade onto any solid surface within short range, including the hull of a Titan. It then sends out a sonar pulse that reveals the current location of all enemies within short range. At the beginning of the next round another sonar pulse is released.

The pulse blade can also be used as a weapon with the following profile: Ranged (Light); damage +1; crit 2; Range (Short); Limited Ammo 1, Pierce 1.

**Use With:** The dataspike is specifically designed to be used with the combat knife.

**Modifiers:** Dataspikes can perform Computers checks for a player with a Computers skill of 2 and an Intellect of 0. If unassisted it rolls [A][A] for Computers checks.

**Hard Points Required:** 1
**Price:** 500

### Enhanced Targeting Algorithm

While most guided weaponry is good as-is, many users tweak the targeting code to acquire a lock faster.

**Use With:** Any weapon with the Guided quality may have this attachment.

**Modifiers:** When you preform the aim maneuver you may add [AD] instead of [B] to your combat check.

**Hard Points Required:** 1
**Price:** 800

**Hard Points Required:** 1

**Price:** 500

### Laser Sight

A simple and lower-tech solution than most on the Frontier are used to, it is a classic for a reason. A laser sight emits a low-level light beam that places a physical dot where the weapon is pointing. But due to the low output it has limited range.

**Use With:** Any firearm can have a laser sight attached.

**Modifiers:** A laser sight adds the Accurate 1 quality, or increases an existing Accurate quality by 1.

**Hard Points Required:** 1

**Price:** 500

### Silencer

### Extra Emitters

Outfitting a cloaking device with extra emitters makes the cloak even more believable and provides even more protection to the soldier wearing it.

**Use With:** This attachment can be applied to the cloaking device.

**Modifiers:** Increase the cloaking device's Defense to 3.

**Hard Points Required:** 1

**Price:** 2,000

Whether you're trying to get away, close the distance or get in or out of a secure site in a hurry, the grapple launcher is just what you need. Some crazy pilots even use it to rodeo a Titan.

**Use With:** This attachment can be applied to any armor.

**Modifiers:** As an action, a character may make an **Easy ([D]) Ranged (Light) check** to secure the grapple launcher on any solid object within short range. On a success, they may, as a maneuver, reel in the cord and pull themselves towards the the object. If the object is unsecured, it instead is pulled to the character.

**Hard Points Required:** 2

**Price:** 350

### Stim Injectors

Stim injectors, or simply 'stims' to those who use them, are used for brief bursts of speed on the battlefield. On command they inject a potent cocktail of adrenaline and various pharmaceuticals that increase speed and reaction time. While it enables characters to get where they're going faster, it does stress the user's system. Use With: This attachment can be applied to any armor.

**Modifiers:** Once per round on your turn after you have performed two maneuvers you may suffer 1 strain to perform the move maneuver as an incidental. At the end of any encounter where your character used the stim injectors, they suffer 3 additional strain.

**Hard Points Required:** 1

**Price:** 2,500
