# Equipment

## New Qualities

The following qualities are available to certain weapons in *Titanfall: Genesys*

### Arc

Arc weapons specialize in taking down energy shields with a massive jolt of arc energy. An arc weapon can negate Defense granted by energy shields by spending [AD][AD] (instead of the usual [AD][AD][AD]).

### Reduced Magazine

Weapons with a Reduced Magazine either doesn't hold much ammo or it goes through ammo at an alarming rate. Either way, this weapon can run out of ammo by spending [TH][TH][TH] (in addition to the normal [DE]).

## Weapons

### Melee Weapons

Not all weapons are firearms. Sometimes you need to get up close and personal. For that, there are several melee weapons available to soldiers.

#### Brass Knuckles

Brass knuckles are very simple weapons: chunks of brass designed to slip over your fingers and add power to your punches.

#### Combat Knife

The ubiquitous knife is easy to use, lightweight and one of the first weapons most soldiers learn to fight with.

#### Longblade

Longblades have been coming back into vogue since the first sight of a Titan carrying a sword of its own. Deadly and silent, this weapon is the preferred weapon of scouts and assassins alike.

#### Stun Baton

A short length of metal with a rubber handle, the stun baton is designed to shock the enemy into submission.

#### Truncheon

Not as common for soldiers, but local law enforcement is commonly seen for their ability to subdue—rather than kill—their target.

### Sidearms

Sidearms are a common sight on the battlefield, as everyone and their mother have one!

#### B3 Wingman

The B3 Wingman is an extremely powerful revolver with very high accuracy out to long ranges. Precision aim is required to mitigate the disadvantages of its very low rate of fire.

#### Hammond P2011

The Hammond P2011 is a semi-automatic handgun with good accuracy and damage at range. Its integrated 'match trigger' allows it to be fired very rapidly, which is useful in close quarters.

#### RE-45 Autopistol

The RE-45 is a fully automatic .45 caliber pistol, sacrificing damage and accuracy at longer distances for improved effectiveness at close range.

#### Smart Pistol MK5

The Smart Pistol scans for hostile targets within a short range, locking onto them automatically. Any rounds fired will then maneuver to hit the locked targets. Aiming with the iron sights allows the operator to use the pistol in manual targeting mode. Spare ammunition for the smart pistol is twice the price as normal ammo, 50 credits.

### Long-arms

#### C.A.R. SMG

The C.A.R. (Combat Advanced Round)
submachine gun is designed to fire a more powerful round that provides greater damage and accuracy at range, at the cost of fire rate and capacity.

#### EVA-8 Shotgun

The EVA-8 is a semi-automatic shotgun, originally designed for extra-vehicular activity, both in conventional and in exo-atmospheric conditions.

#### G2A4 Battle Rifle

Despite recent advances in weapons technology, the older
G2A4 semi-automatic rifle remains a favorite of special forces units due to its high damage and extremely precise fire—a testament to its high level of craftsmanship.

#### Hemlok BF-R

The factory issue Hemlok fires a three-round burst. While this can be a liability at short range, this tradeoff allowed the engineers at TW Ordnance to deliver a weapon with a good balance of long-range accuracy, damage, and fire rate.

#### Kraber-AP Sniper

The Kraber fires a unique round that ensures 'one-shot, one-kill' results against human-scale targets. However, considerable judgement in leading is required, making this a difficult weapon to use against moving targets.

#### Longbow DMR

The D-101 Longbow-DMR is a semi-automatic sniper rifle. Its hyper-velocity round completely eliminates the need to lead targets, and allows the shooter to fire multiple shots quickly in succession.

#### R-101c Carbine

The R-101C is a fully automatic, compact assault weapon commonly used throughout the Frontier.

#### R-97 Compact SMG

The R-97 is a compact submachine gun that excels at close-quarters combat, due to its extremely high rate of fire and minimal recoil. 

#### Spitfire LMG

The Spitfire Light Machine Gun recoils heavily when first fired, but quickly settles into a tight firing pattern. The manufacturer strongly recommends sustained saturating fire, instead of short controlled bursts.

### Pilot Ordnance

Ordnance usually refers to grenades, but some pilots like to carry around things that make a slightly bigger 'boom'.

#### Arc Grenade

The Arc Grenade is a grenade type employed by infantry of the IMC and Militia. When activated, the Arc Grenade explodes in a blast of Arc energy capable of short circuiting and dealing heavy damage to robotic units and equipment such as Titans, Spectres, Stalkers, HUDs and optical equipment found within the helmet of a Pilot and Reapers.

#### Arc Mine

The Arc Mine is a proximity mine that can stick
on any surface. It takes 1 second after sticking to
something to arm. Arc Mines won't explode until an enemy Pilot, Titan, Grunt or Spectre enter the mine's range.

#### Electric Smoke Grenade

A pilot-portable version of the Titan defense system, this “grenade” is designed to obscure an area and disperse pilots in an entrenched position.

The cloud creates two dice worth of concealment and completely negates the Guided weapon quality on any attack against a target within the cloud or if the weapon must target through the cloud.

#### Firestar

The firestar is an incendiary throwing star that creates thermite on impact. It will stick to surfaces and enemies alike.

#### Frag Grenade

The basic explosive device known to all modern soldiers, the Frag Grenade is still an incredibly useful weapon.

#### Satchel Charge

Satchel Charges stick to any surface and are manually detonated, causing massive explosive damage to anything nearby. Like mines, satchel charges are set and triggered to explode. Unlike a mine, however, you must trigger them yourself.

As an action you may place up to two charges within Engaged range. As an out-of-turn incidental you may detonate the charges, making an Engineering combat check against the target.

### Anti-Titan Weapons

#### Archer Heavy Rocket

The Archer fires a powerful homing rocket. It must be locked onto a target before it can be fired.When aimed, a targeting window flips out, allowing target acquisition. Hold this window over the target continuously until a lock is achieved, then fire. The Guided quality can only be activated when attacking targets made of significant metal content, like Titans and Spectres. Reload rockets for the Archer cost 3,000 credit.

#### Charge Rifle

The Charge Rifle fires an energy beam that inflicts massive damage. Holding the trigger charges the weapon. Timing is critical to its use: this weapon will only fire when it reaches full charge, and it will discharge automatically as soon as it hits full charge.

#### Mag Launcher

The Mag Launcher fires magnetic grenades. When fired, the grenades will veer towards nearby enemy Titans and Spectres, and detonate on impact. The Accurate quality can only be activated when attacking targets made of significant metal content, like Titans and Spectres.

#### Sidewinder

The Sidewinder is a rapid-fire micro-missile launcher. It is effective against large targets, but lacks precision due to its large spread. The micro-missiles it fires do not yield a large area effect on detonation, due to their shaped-charge design.

## Armour

### Armoured Carapace

Armoured carapace completely covers the wearer from head to toe and with the right attachments can be environmentally sealed. The carapace has a rigid outer shell that deflects or blocks incoming attacks. It is also designed to be extremely customizable, with one more hard point than a comparable size armour would otherwise have.

### Cloaking Device

Personal cloaking devices blur the outline of the wearer, making it extremely hard to see them. While active, you may hide even when in plain sight.

### Flak Vest

Made from lightweight polymers and ballistic fabrics, this armour provides decent protection against small arms fire and shrapnel.

### Heavy Jacket

Not a form of combat armour, but a well-made jacket does provide limited protection.

## Items

### Gear

A Militia Titan pilot needs more than just a good weapon and heavy armour to defeat the IMC and drive them from their home. In this section you'll find the more mundane—but no less important—items that makes a Militia pilot more than a grunt with a gun.

#### Backpack

While wearing a backpack, your character increases their encumbrance threshold by four.

#### Combat Harness

A combat harness is a system used by soldiers to carry necessary equipment on their persons in easily accessible pouches. They are commonly made of hard-wearing reinforced textiles, and often with removable armor plates.

A combat harness increases a wearer's encumbrance threshold by 2.

#### Comm-Bead

This communications device fits into a sentient's ear (or other auditory orifice) and allows them to communicate with friends and allies within 100 kilometers. If the comm-bead can tie into a planetary communications network (the kind that any civilized planet has), then it can communicate with anyone on the same planet.

An encrypted version of the comm-bead is also available. Any attempt to hack into the encrypted communication is upgraded twice.

#### Cybernetics

See *Genesys* Core Rulebook page 177.

#### Extra Magazine

This is exactly what it sounds like: an extra magazine of ammunition for a ranged weapon.

If your character has an extra magazine, they may spend a maneuver to reload and continue to use their weapon if it runs out of ammo. This uses up the extra magazine. (You  can’t use this to reload weapons with the Limited Ammo quality, as they usually have special costs for their reloads or are one-use weapons.)

#### First Aid Kit

A first aid kit has all the basics you need to tend to minor battlefield injuries. This kit provides your character with the equipment needed to make Medicine checks to heal wounds or Critical Injuries without penalty. However, [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] means your character has used all of the kit's supplies.

#### Jump Kit

Jump Kits provide a brief burst of thrust that is used to leap to higher locations. They also have a function that adjusts the deceleration on potentially fatal descents to safe levels, allowing Pilots to fall from great heights without injury.

When armed with a jump kit, upgrade all Athletics checks to climb and jump once and ignore difficult terrain as long as you can bypass it via a nearby wall or other outcropping. In addition, reduce the overall distance fallen by one range band.

#### Night Optics

These goggles allows the wearer to see in the dark. When wearing night optics, your character removes up to [S][S] added to their checks due to darkness.

#### Painkillers

See page 94 of the *Genesys* Core Rulebook.

#### Panacea

This liquid cocktail of adrenaline and various pharmaceutical drugs is used to temporarily enhance awareness and promote localized healing. The panacea is stored in a one-use syringe that is quickly injected to the subject.

When making a Medicine check, your character may use a panacea to add automatic [SU][AD] to the results. The panacea is consumed when used.

#### Portable Medkit

A well-equipped portable medkit comes with everything someone might need to treat all manner of injuries, from bullet wounds to broken legs.

A portable medkit allows your character to perform Medicine checks to heal wounds and Critical Injuries without penalty. The inclusion of modern drugs adds automatic [AD] to the check results.

#### Pulse Blade

the pulse blade can be thrown and provides a brief sonar pulse that can detect enemies even through walls.

As an action, a character may make an **Average ([D][D]) Ranged (Light) check** to secure the blade to any solid surface within short range, including the hull of a Titan. On a success it sends out a sonar pulse that reveals the current location of all enemies within short range. At the beginning of the next round another sonar pulse is released. 

The pulse blade can also be used as a weapon with the following profile: Ranged (Light); damage +1; crit 4; Range (Short); Limited Ammo 1, Pierce 1.

#### Utility Belt

Often worn in addition to a combat harness, or used as a component, utility belts are common items for militia in the field where quick access to important tools is a life-saving necessity. Contents and configurations vary by user and by mission; many include integral holsters or gun belts.

Utility belts increase a wearer's encumbrance threshold
by 1.

### Dataspike

The Dataspike is a tool used to hack into enemy Spectres, turrets or other computing devices. It has an on-board AI programmed specifically to hack into enemy computers. \
**Use With:** The dataspike is specifically designed to be used with the combat knife. \
**Modifiers:** Dataspikes can perform Computers checks for a player with a Computers skill of 2 and an Intellect of 0. If unassisted it rolls [A][A] for Computers checks (see pages 26—27 of the *Genesys* Core Rulebook for rules on assisted checks). \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 500

### Enhanced Targeting Algorithm

While most guided weaponry is good as-is, many users tweak the targeting code to acquire a lock faster. \
**Use With:** Any weapon with the Guided quality may have this attachment. \
**Modifiers:** When you preform the aim maneuver you may add [AD] instead of [B] to your combat check. \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 800

### Holosight

This device projects a hologram of a crosshair a meter or so in front of the barrel to aid in aiming the weapon. Unfortunately that also makes it easier to spot the shooter. \
**Use With:** Any firearm can have a holosight added. \
**Modifiers:** The shooter may aim as an incidental once per round at a target up to medium range. If the holosight is used, reduce any concealment dice the target is benefiting from by 1 until the beginning of the character's next turn (see page 110 of the *Genesys* Core Rulebook for concealment rules). \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 500

### Laser Sight

A simple and lower-tech solution than most on the Frontier are used to, it is a classic for a reason. A laser sight emits a low-level light beam that places a physical dot where the weapon is pointing. But due to the low output it has limited range. \
**Use With:** Any firearm can have a laser sight attached. \
**Modifiers:** A laser sight adds the Accurate 1 quality, or increases an existing Accurate quality by 1. \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 500

**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 2,000

### Stim Injectors

Stim injectors, or simply 'stims' to those who use them, are used for brief bursts of speed on the battlefield. On command they inject a potent cocktail of adrenaline and various pharmaceuticals that increase speed and reaction time. While it enables characters to get where they're going faster, it does stress the user's system. Use With: This attachment can be applied to any armor. \
**Modifiers:** Once per round on your turn after you have performed two maneuvers you may suffer 1 strain to perform the move maneuver as an incidental. At the end of any encounter where your character used the stim injectors, they suffer 3 additional strain. \
