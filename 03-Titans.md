# Titans

Titans are mech-style robots, descended from modern-day fledgling military exoskeletons, designed for both civilian and military applications.

There are three classes of titans, as described below.

## Special Rules

All titans have the following special rule:

**Humanoid Form:** As long as a Titan's propulsion isn't compromised it ignores the speed requirement for the Reposition maneuver.

<h5>Atlas-Class Titan</h5>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-bec-k/TitanfallGenesys/master/img/Atlas.png" style="width:80%; float: left;"></img>

The Atlas is the original Titan model produced by Hammond Robotics. It has a balance of mobility and armor, having more mobility than the Ogre, but more armor than the Stryder. This was the first Titan to be revealed.

The Atlas seems to be the second tallest Titan model, though exact measurements are unknown. Based on photos of the Atlas standing next to a pilot, it can be estimated to be between 20-25 feet tall. Its main entry point is in its chest, which opens up for the player. The Atlas also has a secondary entry point—a small hatch in the top. This is also the eject port for the Atlas.

#### <u>Titans and Limited Ammo</u>

Titans regularly have ordnance weapons on-board that has the Limited Ammo quality.  Although normally Limited Ammo weapons can be reloaded with a maneuver once exhausted, Titans generally carry only one payload of ordnance, and must be reloaded back at a base or carrier starship. They cannot be reloaded in mid-combat!
</div>


The Atlas is the oldest Titan model on the Frontier and has instigated the development of both the Stryder and Ogre patterns. It was used through the Titan Wars, and onto the Frontier War. The Atlas is equipped with a Damage Core, which, when ready, the pilot can activate on command to substantially increase damage dealt by the Titan.

<h5>Ogre-Class Titan</h5>

The H-KA02/a Ogre Heavy Titan is a Titan model produced by Hammond Armament Division and Wonyeon Defense. Developed as an extremely tough Titan chassis, the Ogre's design has been compared to a main battle tank, optimized for taking higher amounts of damage and dealing out more than the Atlas or Stryder Titans. The Ogre stands slightly taller than the Atlas and has bulkier armor. The main entry point of an Ogre is via a large hatch on its top rather than the chest, like the Atlas or Stryder. The Ogre is equipped with a Shield Core, which amps the Titan's shield for a limited time.

**Shield Core:** The Ogre-class Titan has an in-built shield core. Once per round on your turn, you may cause the titan to suffer 1 system strain to perform the Brace for Impact maneuver as an Incidental. /

<h5>Stryder-Class Titan</h5>

The Stryder is a Titan chassis developed and manufactured by Hammond Robotics. Developed as an extremely mobile and maneuverable Titan variant, the Stryder's almost skeletal design has been optimized for superior speed and agility. Significant improvements have been made to its Dash Core, while the Titan can also sprint for greater distances, making it perfect for hit-and-run attacks, ambushes and rapid redeployments. Unfortunately, this speed comes at a price. The Stryder's design is stripped down compared to other Titan variants, and its armor is largely nonexistent, making it much more fragile in combat. In Titan-vs-Titan engagements, Stryder Pilots must use all available cover and their machine's impressive speed to outflank and evade their heavier adversaries, as they are unlikely to survive a straight-up slug-fest.

**Dash Core:** The Stryder-class Titan has an in-built dash core. Once per round on your turn, you may cause the titan to suffer 1 system strain to perform the Evade maneuver as an Incidental, ignoring the Speed requirement.

## Titan Systems

### Main Weapons

All main Titan weapons take both hands to use properly. A titan may hold it in one hand and use the other for something else, like punching someone or grabbing onto something, but requires both of the Titan's hands in order to fire them.

Titan weapons are designed to be held in an external rig so if a Titan needs both hand it can stow and retrieve them with a maneuver.

#### 40mm Cannon

The factory issue 40mm Cannon is a semi-automatic weapon that fires a high-explosive round with good accuracy.

#### Arc Cannon

The factory issue Arc Cannon fires a bolt of lightning that propagates across multiple targets. It can be fired quickly, or charged up over time for an increase in firepower. If you perform the Prepare maneuver, increase the damage of one hit of the next combat check by 1.

#### PR-01 Plasma Railgun

The Plasma Railgun is a Titan-sized sniper weapon, used for suppression of armored targets from a distance. The weapon fires a bolt of plasma, accelerated by a system of charged rails.

#### Quad Rocket

The Quad Rocket is a weapon that fires a tight-knit cluster of 4 rockets at the target, exploding upon impact.

#### Triple Threat

The Triple Threat is a grenade launcher that shoots 3 grenades at once. It excels at clearing rooms, and its grenades explode on armored contact, making it effective at close range against other Titans.

#### XOTBR-16 Chaingun

The XO-16 Chaingun is a fully automatic ballistic weapon that fires 1.6 inch slugs with high precision at considerable range.

### Titan Ordnance

#### Cluster Missile

The Cluster Missile pod fires a missile which, on impact, deploys a shower of secondary explosive charges that continue to explode and saturate an area for a considerable time.

#### Laser Shot

The laser shot fires a lethal beam that cuts through anything in its way. It’s a directed energy weapon that takes the charge rifle and and amps it up to Titan-scale.

#### Multi-Target Missile System

The Multi-Target Missile System enables you to engage multiple targets at once. The Guided quality can only be activated when attacking targets made of significant metal content, like Titans and Spectres.

#### Rocket Salvo

The Rocket Salvo launches a rapid salvo of unguided rockets. Each [SU] deals +2 damage, instead of +1.

#### Slaved Warheads

This Titan ordnance pod requires a lock-on before you can fire. When you fire, a barrage of 3 homing missiles will launch towards your locked target. The Guided quality can only be activated when attacking targets made of significant metal content, like Titans and Spectres.

### Titan Defense Systems

Titans are not indestructible, regardless of what the IMC wants you to believe. Each Titan is equipped with one of three defensive systems, designed to prolong the lifespan of the Titan.

#### Electric Smoke

Electric smoke is a reactionary device used to avoid attacks and negate tracking weapons.

Once per round, as an out-of-turn incidental, you may deploy a smoke charge. If this was done as a reaction to being targeted by a Guided weapon, the tracking is lost and the weapon may not fire on your Titan this turn. It creates an area of obscurant around your Titan that grants concealment worth +3 dice (see page 110 of the *Genesys* Core Rulebook). Any pilot on your Titan must immediately move away from your Titan or risk taking damage from the electric smoke. If they won’t (or can’t) disembark, they must make a **Hard (<[D[D[D]]]) Resilience check** or suffer 1 wound, plus 1 additional wound per [FA]. If the Resilience check generates [TH][TH][TH], they become Disoriented for two rounds. This cloud lasts until the end of your next turn. Any pilot that ends their turn in the smoke must make the Resilience check or suffer wound as described above.

Electric smoke comes equipped with 3 smoke canisters.

#### Particle Wall

The particle wall creates a concave force field which blocks all projectiles from one side and lets all projectiles through from the other. As an incidental you may deploy the particle wall in front of your Titan. It grants Ranged Defense 4 to everything behind the wall. It lasts until the end of your next turn, and it requires two rounds to recharge before it can be used again.

#### Vortex Shield

The Vortex Shield allows Titans to stop enemy fire such as rockets and bullets in their tracks and is able to send the projectiles right back to the enemy.

As an out-of-turn incidental you may deploy the vortex shield when targeted by a ranged combat check. It provides the Reflective 1 quality until the beginning of your next turn. If the triggering attack generates [TH][TH][TH], you may reflect the projectile (if any) back on the target, dealing the weapon’s base damage to the attacker. If the check generates [DE], you instead deal a Critical Injury (or a Critical Hit for vehicles).
