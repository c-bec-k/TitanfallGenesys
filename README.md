# Titanfall: Genesys

## Introduction
*Titanfall: Genesys* is a work-in-progress mod for the *Genesys* RPG. It is currently under development and anyone who would like to assist is welcome to contact me to render aid!

This mod is based off of the original FPS published in 2014. I will be pulling a few things from the sequel, but as I have not played it most of the content is based on the original. Please keep that in mind.
