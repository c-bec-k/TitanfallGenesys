# Welcome to the Militia

Humanity lives in the deepest reaches of explored space in a vast region known as The Frontier. It contains many well-known and inhabited solar systems, but many more worlds remain uncharted. Most people will never travel this far away from normal civilization, but for pioneers, explorers, mercenaries, outlaws, and soldiers—the Frontier offers both adventure and opportunity.

The Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) originally funded many expeditions to the Frontier, promising veterans of their military campaigns in the "Core Systems"—the region of space containing the IMC's inhabited worlds including Earth—free land and other benefits in return for starting up businesses and colonies on the Frontier. Eventually, the IMC withdrew this support, leaving the colonists stranded without outside assistance for several decades.

Over time, life continued on the Frontier largely independent from the Core Systems. However, when the IMC returned several decades later to claim eminent domain over the Frontier's land, people and resources, the people of the Frontier united as the Frontier Militia, utilizing guerrilla and terrorist actions to further their cause.

This is where you come in. You grew up in the Frontier, it is your home. Now the IMC is back and claiming everything you worked your entire life for is theirs. It isn't. You know that; now they need to learn it. Welcome to the Titan War.

# Archetypes

Every character is built upon an archetype and *Titanfall: Genesys* has five archetypes to choose from. With the *Titanfall* setting being populated by humans, there are no non-human species—just human archetypes.

## Archetypes to Include

All CRB archetypes, plus:

* Athlete
* Cyborg (SotB)
* Opportunist (trickster from EPG)
* Maybe others from the EPG


# New Skills & Rules

This section introduces new skills specific to the <em>Titanfall: Genesys</em> setting. Please see the following table for a complete list of skills available, including the new skills outlined below as well as those listed in the <em>Genesys</em> Core Rule Book. It also covers rules for rodeoing Titans.


The new and modified skills are as follows:

<h2>General Skills</h2>

The new skills in this section replace the Pilot skill presented in the <em>Genesys</em> Core Rule Book.

<h3>Pilot (Aerospace) (Agility)</h3>

This skill covers the use and operation of any vehicle that flies through an atmosphere or in space. This takes the place of the Pilot skill from the <em>Genesys</em> Core Rule Book (found on pages 62–63).

<h3>Pilot (Titan) (Cunning)</h3>

This skill covers the intricacies of piloting the massive war machines called Titans. Not only do you need to have quick reflexes to pilot them, but you need to know how the Titan moves compared to that of more conventional vehicles.

<h5>Your character should use this skill if…</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Your character is using their Titan to punch a target.</li>
  <li>Your character maneuvers a Titan through a dense city block while under fire.</li>
  <li>Your character is trying to dock a badly-damaged Titan.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Your character should not use this skill if…</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Your character is flying a shuttle craft. That falls under the Pilot (Aerospace) skill.</li>
  <li>Your character wants to fix a Titan. That uses the Mechanics skill.</li>
  <li>Your character is walking the Titan from Point A to Point B without any fear of failure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Knowledge Skills</h2>

<h3>Frontier (Intellect)</h3>

The systems of the Frontier are filled with independent worlds and even more independent inhabitants, many of which enjoy their isolation and relative freedom. Because of this, the worlds exhibit an astoundingly diverse mix of cultures and political systems.

Due to this diversity, knowledge of one world's culture and politics doesn't guarantee knowledge of other worlds—even neighbouring worlds. However, there are common threads throughout the Frontier, if you know where to look.

<h5>Your character should use this skill if…</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Your character is looking for a specific item or service and wants to know what planet would be best suited for such a purchase.</li>
  <li>Your character is trying to lay low and doesn't want to be asked too many questions.</li>
  <li>Your character wants to interact with a local political leader and doesn't want to make a fool of themselves.</li>
</ul>


<h5>Your character should not use this skill if…</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Your character is trying to navigate the Frontier, that would be an Astrocartography check.</li>
  <li>Your character wants to find a specific black market contact, that would be an Underworld check.</li>
  <li>The information your character is looking for is public knowledge, in such a case no check is required.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Underworld (Intellect)</h3>

In some places, criminal elements control the government through less-than-legal machinations. In others, the crime families function as the only effective ruling force. In more traditionally governed areas, seedier elements are dependent upon secrecy and deception as the core elements of their practices. Before a character can even begin to establish contacts among a world's criminal elements, he must first understand which of these organizational structures are in play.

\pagebreakNum

Once a character deciphers how he might establish a contact, he must next find out with whom he needs to speak. Different groups or individuals might control different parts of the criminal trade. A contact for gambling is likely different than one who deals in illicit pharmaceuticals, while a third individual is likely the point of contact for miltery-grade weapons. Depending upon a character's needs and the criminal elements active on a world, finding the right contact could be trivial or extremely time-consuming.

<h5>Your character should use this skill if…</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Your character wants to know what nearby world would be best for a particular type of illegal business.</li>
  <li>Your character tries to figure out what method someone would use for a specific type of criminal activity.</li>
  <li>Your character is trying to figure out which criminal organization is the real power on a specific planet.</li>
</ul>


<h5>Your character should not use this skill if…</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Your character is attempting to blend in to the local underworld. That is a Streetwise check.</li>
  <li>Your character is pretending to be a member of a certain gang, which would be a Deception check.</li>
  <li>Your character is trying to know who is in charge of a well-known organization. Common knowledge like that does not require a roll.</li>
</ul>

\columnbreak

<h3>Warfare (Intellect)</h3>

The <em>Titanfall</em> galaxy has been shaped for decades by warfare. From the past wars of the Core Worlds to the current Titan War between the Frontier Militia and the IMC. Characters with knowledge of the workings of war are more important than ever before.

This skill covers a character's knowledge of conflict, both on the ground and in space. Many things factor into this, from training and insight on the strategies and tactics of modern warfare, to an awareness of the personnel and technology of the factions involved in the conflict, to knowledge gained from studying the other great wars throughout history. Having a broad awareness of the workings and history of conflict allows a character to not only to survive, but to thrive in the Titan War.

<h5>Your character should use this skill if…</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Your character attempts to recall an important military event, organization or individual.</li>
  <li>Your character is formulating a military tactic.</li>
  <li>Your character tries to recognize an opposing military tactic.</li>
</ul>


<h5>Your character should not use this skill if…</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Your character is leading a squad. That falls under the Leadership skill.</li>
  <li>Your character teaches a textbook tactic. Knowledge such as that requires no skill check.</li>
  <li>Your character is flying a capital ship. Such skill is covered by Operating.</li>
</ul>

###### Arc

### Melee Weapons

Not all weapons are firearms. Sometimes you need to get up close and personal. For that, there are several melee weapons available to soldiers.

#### Brass Knuckles
Brass knuckles are very simple weapons: chunks of brass designed to slip over your fingers and add power to your punches.

#### Combat Knife

The ubiquitous knife is easy to use, lightweight and one of the first weapons most soldiers learn to fight with.

\columnbreak

#### Longblade

Longblades have been coming back into vogue since the first sight of a Titan carrying a sword of its own. Deadly and silent, this weapon is the preferred weapon of scouts and assassins alike.


#### Stun Baton

A short length of metal with a rubber handle, the stun baton is designed to shock the enemy into submission.


#### Truncheon

Not as common for soldiers, but local law enforcement is commonly seen for their ability to subdue—rather than kill—their target.

### Sidearms

Sidearms are a common sight on the battlefield, as everyone and their mother have one!

#### B3 Wingman

The B3 Wingman is an extremely powerful revolver with very high accuracy out to long ranges. Precision aim is re-quired to mitigate the disadvantages of its very low rate of fire.

#### Hammond P2011

The Hammond P2011 is a semi-automatic handgun with good accuracy and damage at range. Its integrated 'match trigger' allows it to be fired very rapidly, which is useful in close quarters. 

#### RE-45 Autopistol

The RE-45 is a fully automatic .45 caliber pistol, sacrificing damage and accuracy at longer distances for improved effectiveness at close range.

#### Smart Pistol MK5

The Smart Pistol scans for hostile targets within a short range, locking onto them automatically. Any rounds fired will then maneuver to hit the locked targets. Aiming with the iron sights allows the operator to use the pistol in manual targeting mode. Spare ammunition for the smart pistol is twice the price as normal ammo, 50 credits.

### Longarms

#### C.A.R. SMG

The C.A.R. (Combat Advanced Round)
submachine gun is designed to fire a more powerful round that provides greater damage and accuracy at range, at the cost of fire rate and capacity.

#### EVA-8 Shotgun

The EVA-8 is a semi-automatic shotgun, originally designed for extra-vehicular activity, both in conventional and in exo-atmospheric conditions.

#### G2A4 Battle Rifle

Despite recent advances in weapons technology, the older
G2A4 semi-automatic rifle remains a favorite of special forces units due to its high damage and extremely precise fire—a testament to its high level of craftsmanship.

#### Hemlok BF-R

The factory issue Hemlok fires a three-round burst. While this can be a liability at short range, this tradeoff allowed the engineers at TW Ordnance to deliver a weapon with a good balance of long-range accuracy, damage, and fire rate.

#### Kraber-AP Sniper

The Kraber fires a unique round that ensures 'one-shot, one-kill' results against human-scale targets. However, considerable judgement in leading is required, making this a difficult weapon to use against moving targets.

#### Longbow DMR

The D-101 Longbow-DMR is a semi-automatic sniper rifle. Its hyper-velocity round completely eliminates the need to lead targets, and allows the shooter to fire multiple shots quickly in succession.

\columnbreak

#### R-101c Carbine

The R-101C is a fully automatic, compact assault weapon commonly used throughout the Frontier.

#### R-97 Compact SMG

The R-97 is a compact submachine gun that excels at close-quarters combat, due to its extremely high rate of fire and minimal recoil. 

#### Spitfire LMG

The Spitfire Light Machine Gun recoils heavily when first fired, but quickly settles into a tight firing pattern. The manufacturer strongly recommends sustained saturating fire, instead of short controlled bursts.

### Pilot Ordnance

Ordnance usually refers to grenades, but some pilots like to carry around things that make a slightly bigger 'boom'.

#### Arc Grenade

The Arc Grenade is a grenade type employed by infantry of the IMC and Militia. When activated, the Arc Grenade explodes in a blast of Arc energy capable of short circuiting and dealing heavy damage to robotic units and equipment such as Titans, Spectres, Stalkers, HUDs and optical equipment found within the helmet of a Pilot and Reapers.

#### Arc Mine

The Arc Mine is a proximity mine that can stick
on any surface. It takes 1 second after sticking to
something to arm. Arc Mines won't explode until an enemy Pilot, Titan, Grunt or Spectre enter the mine's range.

#### Electric Smoke Grenade

A pilot-portable version of the Titan defense system, this “grenade” is designed to obscure an area and disperse pilots in an entrenched position.

The cloud creates two dice worth of concealment and completely negates the Guided weapon quality on any attack against a target within the cloud or if the weapon must target through the cloud.

\pagebreakNum

#### Firestar

The firestar is an incendiary throwing star that creates thermite on impact. It will stick to surfaces and enemies alike.

#### Frag Grenade

The basic explosive device known to all modern soldiers, the Frag Grenade is still an incredibly useful weapon.

#### Satchel Charge

Satchel Charges stick to any surface and are manually detonated, causing massive explosive damage to anything nearby. Like mines, satchel charges are set and triggered to explode. Unlike a mine, however, you must trigger them yourself.

As an action you may place up to two charges within Engaged range. As an out-of-turn incidental you may detonate the charges, making an Engineering combat check against the target.

### Anti-Titan Weapons

#### Archer Heavy Rocket

The Archer fires a powerful homing rocket. It must be locked onto a target before it can be fired.When aimed, a targeting window flips out, allowing target acquisition. Hold this window over thetarget continuously until a lock is achieved, then fire. The Guided quality can only be activated when attacking targets made of significant metal content, like Titans and Spectres. Reload rockets for the Archer cost 3,000 credit.

#### Charge Rifle

The Charge Rifle fires an energy beam that inflicts massive damage. Holding the trigger charges the weapon. Timing is critical to its use: this weapon will only fire when it reaches full charge, and it will discharge automatically as soon as it hits full charge.

#### Mag Launcher

The Mag Launcher fires magnetic grenades. When fired, the grenades will veer towards nearby enemy Titans and Spectres, and detonate on impact. The Accurate quality can only be activated when attacking targets made of significant metal content, like Titans and Spectres.


#### Sidewinder

The Sidewinder is a rapid-fire micro-missile launcher. It is effective against large targets, but lacks precision due to its large spread. The micro-missiles it fires do not yield a large area effect on detonation, due to their shaped-charge design.


## Armour

### Armoured Carapace

Armoured carapace completely covers the wearer from head to toe and with the right attachments can be environmentally sealed. The carapace has a rigid outer shell that deflects or blocks incoming attacks. It is also designed to be extremely customizable, with one more hard point than a comparable size armour would otherwise have.

### Cloaking Device

Personal cloaking devices blur the outline of the wearer, making it extremely hard to see them. While active, you may hide even when in plain sight.

\columnbreak

### Flak Vest

Made from lightweight polymers and ballistic fabrics, this armour provides decent protection against small arms fire and shrapnel.

### Heavy Jacket

Not a form of combat armour, but a well-made jacket does provide limited protection.

# Items

## Gear

A Militia Titan pilot needsmore than just a good weapon and heavy armour to defeat the IMC and drive them from their home. In this section you'll find the more mundane—but no less important—items that makes a Militia pilot more than a grunt with a gun.

### Backpack

While wearing a backpack, your character increases their encumbrance threshold by four.

### Combat Harness
A combat harness is a system used by soldiers to carry necessary equipment on their persons in easily accessible pouches. They are commonly made of hard-wearing reinforced textiles, and often with removable armor plates.

A combat harness increases a wearer's encumbrance threshold by 2.


### Comm-Bead

This communications device fits into a sentient's ear (or other auditory orifice) and allows them to communicate with friends and allies within 100 kilometers. If the comm-bead can tie into a planetary communications network (the kind that any civilized planet has), then it can communicate with anyone on the same planet.

An encrypted version of the comm-bead is also available. Any attempt to hack into the encrypted communication is upgraded twice. 

### Cybernetics
See *Genesys* Core Rulebook page 177.

### Extra Magazine

This is exactly what it sounds like: an extra magazine of ammunition for a ranged weapon.

If your character has an extra magazine, they may spend a maneuver to reload and continue to use their weapon if it runs out of ammo. This uses up the extra magazine. (You  can’t use this to reload weapons with the Limited Ammo quality, as they usually have special costs for their reloads or are one-use weapons.)

### First Aid Kit

A first aid kit has all the basics you need to tend to minor battlefield injuries. This kit provides your character with the equipment needed to make Medicine checks to heal wounds or Critical Injuries without penalty. However, <span class="symbols">hhh</span> or <span class="symbols">d</span> means your characterhas used allof the kit's supplies.

### Jump Kit

Jump Kits provide a brief burst of thrust that is used to leap to higher locations. They also have a function that adjusts the deceleration on potentially fatal descents to safe levels, allowing Pilots to fall from great heights without injury.

When armed with a jump kit, upgrade all Athletics checks to climb and jump once and ignore difficult terrain as long as you can bypass it via a nearby wall or other outcropping. In addition, reduce the overall distance fallen by one range band.

### Night Optics

These goggles allows the wearer to see in the dark. When wearingnight optics, your character removes up to <span class="setback">bb</span> added to their checks due to darkness. 

### Painkillers

See page 94 of the *Genesys* Core Rulebook.

### Panacea

This liquid cocktail of adrenaline and various pharmaceutical drugs is used to temporarily enhance awareness and promote localized healing. The panacea is stored in a one-use syringe that is quickly injected to the subject.

When making a Medicine check, your character may use a panacea to add automatic <span class='symbols'>sa</span> to the results. The panacea is consumed when used.

### Portable Medkit

A well-equipped portable medkit comes with everything someone might need to treat all manner of injuries, from bullet wounds to broken legs.

\pagebreakNum

A portable medkit allows your character to perform Medicine checks to heal wounds and Critical Injuries without penalty. The inclusion of modern drugs adds automatic <span class='symbols'>a</span> to the check results.

### Pulse Blade

the pulse blade can be thrown and provides a brief sonar pulse that can detect enemies even through walls.

As an action, a charactermay make an <b>Average (<span class='difficulty'>dd</span>) Ranged (Light) check</b> to secure the blade to any solid surface within short range, including the hull of a Titan. On a success it sends out a sonar pulse that reveals the current location of all enemies within short range. At the beginning of the next round another sonar pulse is released. 

The pulse blade can also be used as a weapon with the following profile: Ranged (Light); damage +1; crit 4; Range (Short); Limited Ammo 1, Pierce 1.

### Utility Belt

Often worn in addition to a combat harness, or used as a component, utility belts are common items for militia in the field where quick access to important tools is a life-saving necessity. Contents and configurations vary by user and by mission; many include integral holsters or gun belts.

Utility belts increase a wearer's encumbrance threshold
by 1.

### Dataspike

The Dataspike is a tool used to hack into enemy Spectres, turrets or other computing devices. It has an on-board AI programmed specifically to hack into enemy computers. \
**Use With:** The dataspike is specifically designed to be used with the combat knife. \
**Modifiers:** Dataspikes can perform Computers checks for a player with a Computers skill of 2 and an Intellect of 0. If unassisted it rolls <span class='ability'>dd</span> for Computers checks (see pages 26–27 of the *Genesys* Core Rulebook for rules on assisted checks). \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 500

### Enhanced Targeting Algorithm

While most guided weaponry is good as-is, many users tweak the targeting code to acquire a lock faster. \
**Use With:** Any weapon with the Guided quality may have this attachment. \
**Modifiers:** When you preform the aim maneuver you may add <span class='symbols'>a</span> instead of <span class='boost'>b</span> to your combat check. \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 800

### Holosight

This device projects a hologram of a crosshair a meter or so in front of the barrel to aid in aiming the weapon. Unfortunately that also makes it easier to spot the shooter. \
**Use With:** Any firearm can have a holosight added. \
**Modifiers:** The shooter may aim as an incidental once per round at a target up to medium range. If the holosight is used, reduce any concealment dice the target is benefiting from by 1 until the beginning of the character's next turn (see page 110 of the *Genesys* Core Rulebook for concealment rules). \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 500

\pagebreakNum

### Laser Sight

A simple and lower-tech solution than most on the Frontier are used to, it is a classic for a reason. A laser sight emits a low-level light beam that places a physical dot where the weapon is pointing. But due to the low output it has limited range. \
**Use With:** Any firearm can have a laser sight attached. \
**Modifiers:** A laser sight adds the Accurate 1 quality, or increases an existing Accurate quality by 1. \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 500

### Silencer

A silencer makes it harder for others to pinpoint the location of shots made with the weapon it is attached to. \
**Use With:** Any firearm can have a silencer attached. \
**Modifiers:** Adds <span class='setback'>bb</span> to any Perception or Vigilance checks to locate the shooter firing the weapon. \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 100

## Armour Attachments

The following armour attachments are available to characters in the *Titanfall: Genesys* setting. In addition, several attachments from the *Genesys* Core Rulebook are available.

Italicized attachments are new and found in the following section.

</table>


### Extra Emitters

Outfitting a cloaking device with extra emitters makes the cloak even more believable and provides even more protection to the soldier wearing it. \
**Use With:** This attachment can be applied to the cloaking device. \
**Modifiers:** Increase the cloaking device's Defense to 3. \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 2,000

\columnbreak

### Extra Padding

This attachment adds a layer of padding to the cloaking device to help absorb the impact of weapons that are not fooled by the illusion. Use With: This attachment can be applied to the cloaking device. \
**Modifiers:** Increase the cloaking device's soak and encumbrance by +1. \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 300

### Grapple Launcher

The grapple launcher has a weighted head designed to pierce and hold firm to any solid surface. It allows the wearer to traverse longer distances than normal—even straight up! Whether you're trying to get away, close the distance or get in or out of a secure site in a hurry, the grap-ple launcher is just what you need. Some crazy pilots even use it to rodeo a Titan! \
**Use With:** This attachment can be applied to any armor. \
**Modifiers:** As an action, a character may make an **Average (<span class='difficulty'>dd</span>) Ranged (Light) check** to secure the grapple launcher on any solid object within short range. On a success, they may, as a maneuver, reel in the cord and pull themselves towards the the object. If the object is unsecured, it instead is pulled to the character. \
**Hard Points Required:** 2 \
**Price:** 350

\pagebreakNum

### Stim Injectors

Stim injectors, or simply 'stims' to those who use them, are used for brief bursts of speed on the battlefield. On command they inject a potent cocktail of adrenaline and various pharmaceu-ticals that increase speed and reaction time. While it enables characters to get where they're going faster, it does stress the user's system. Use With: This attachment can be applied to any armor. \
**Modifiers:** Once per round on your turn after you have performed two maneuvers you may suffer 1 strain to perform the move maneuver as an incidental. At the end of any encounter where your character used the stim injectors, they suffer 3 additional strain. \
**Hard Points Required:** 1 \
**Price:** 2,500

# Titans

Titans are mech-style robots, descended from modern-day fledgling military exoskeletons, designed for both civilian and military applications.

There are three classes of titans, as described below.

<h2>Special Rules</h2>

All titans have the following special rule:

<strong>Humanoid Form:</strong> As long as a Titan's propulsion isn't compromised it ignores the speed requirement for the Reposition maneuver.

<h5>Atlas-Class Titan</h5>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-bec-k/TitanfallGenesys/master/img/Atlas.png" style="width:80%; float: left;"></img>

The Atlas is the original Titan model produced by Hammond Robotics. It has a balance of mobility and armor, having more mobility than the Ogre, but more armor than the Stryder. This was the first Titan to be revealed.

The Atlas seems to be the second tallest Titan model, though exact measurements are unknown. Based on photos of the Atlas standing next to a pilot, it can be estimated to be between 20-25 feet tall. Its main entry point is in its chest, which opens up for the player. The Atlas also has a secondary entry point—a small hatch in the top. This is also the eject port for the Atlas.

\columnbreak

<div class="note">
<h4><u>Titans and Limited Ammo</u></h4>

Titans regularly have ordnance weapons on-board that has the Limited Ammo quality.  Although normally Limited Ammo weapons can be reloaded with a maneuver once exhausted, Titans
generally carry only one payload of ordnance, and must be reloaded back at a base or carrier starship. They cannot be reloaded in mid-combat!
</div>


The Atlas is the oldest Titan model on the Frontier and has instigated the development of both the Stryder and Ogre patterns. It was used through the Titan Wars, and onto the Frontier War. The Atlas is equipped with a Damage Core, which, when ready, the pilot can activate on command to substantially increase damage dealt by the Titan.

<h5>Ogre-Class Titan</h5>

<img src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/titanfall/images/b/b8/Titan_chassis_ogre_img_med.png'></img>

The H-KA02/a Ogre Heavy Titan is a Titan model produced by Hammond Armament Division and Wonyeon Defense. Developed as an extremely tough Titan chassis, the Ogre's design has been compared to a main battle tank, optimized for taking higher amounts of damage and dealing out more than the Atlas or Stryder Titans. The Ogre stands slightly taller than the Atlas and has bulkier armor. The main entry point of an Ogre is via a large hatch on its top rather than the chest, like the Atlas or Stryder. The Ogre is equipped with a Shield Core, which amps the Titan's shield for a limited time.

<h5>Stryder-Class Titan</h5>

<img src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/titanfall/images/e/ec/Stryder_IMC.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/408?cb=20140302052432' style="width:65%;"></img>

The Stryder is a Titan chassis developed and manufactured by Hammond Robotics. Developed as an extremely mobile and maneuverable Titan variant, the Stryder's almost skeletal design has been optimized for superior speed and agility. Significant improvements have been made to its Dash Core, while the Titan can also sprint for greater distances, making it perfect for hit-and-run attacks, ambushes and rapid redeployments. Unfortunately, this speed comes at a price. The Stryder's design is stripped down compared to other Titan variants, and its armor is largely nonexistent, making it much more fragile in combat. In Titan-vs-Titan engagements, Stryder Pilots must use all available cover and their machine's impressive speed to outflank and evade their heavier adversaries, as they are unlikely to survive a straight-up slug-fest.

# Titan Systems

### Main Weapons

All main Titan weapons take both hands to use properly. A titan may hold it in one hand and use the other for something else, like punching someone or grabbing onto something, but requires both of the Titan's hands in order to fire them.

Titan weapons are designed to be held in an external rig so if a Titan needs both hand it can stow and retrieve them with a maneuver.

#### 40mm Cannon
The factory issue 40mm Cannon is a semi-automatic weapon that fires a high-explosive round with good accuracy.



#### Arc Cannon

The factory issue Arc Cannon fires a bolt of lightning that propagates across multiple targets. It can be fired quickly, or charged up over time for an increase in firepower. If you perform the Prepare maneuver, increase the damage of one hit of the next combat check by 1.

#### PR-01 Plasma Railgun

The Plasma Railgun is a Titan-sized sniper weapon, used for suppression of armored targets from a distance. The weapon fires a bolt of plasma, accelerated by a system of charged rails.

#### Quad Rocket

The Quad Rocket is a weapon that fires a tight-knit cluster of 4 rockets at the target, exploding upon impact.


#### Triple Threat

The Triple Threat is a grenade launcher that shoots 3 grenades at once. It excels at clearing rooms, and its grenades explode on armored contact, making it effective at close range against other Titans.

#### XOTBR-16 Chaingun

The XO-16 Chaingun is a fully automatic ballistic weapon that fires 1.6 inch slugs with high precision at considerable range.

### Titan Ordnance

#### Cluster Missile

The Cluster Missile pod fires a missile which, on impact, deploys a shower of secondary explosive charges that continue to explode and saturate an area for a considerable time.

#### Laser Shot

The laser shot fires a lethal beam that cuts through anything in its way. It’s a directed energy weapon that takes the charge rifle and and amps it up to Titan-scale.

#### Multi-Target Missile System

The Multi-Target Missile System enables you to engage multiple targets at once. The Guided quality can only be activated when attacking targets made of significant metal content, like Titans and Spectres.

### Titan Defense Systems

Titans are not indestructible, regardless of what the IMC wants you to believe. Each Titan is equipped with one of three defensive systems, designed to prolong the lifespan of the Titan.

#### Electric Smoke
Electric smoke is a reactionary device used to avoid attacks and negate tracking weapons.

Once per round, as an out-of-turn incidental, you may deploy a smoke charge. If this was done as a reaction to being targeted by a Guided weapon, the tracking is lost and the weapon may not fire on your Titan this turn. It creates an area of obscurant around your Titan that grants concealment worth +3 dice (see page 110 of the *Genesys* Core Rulebook). Any pilot on your Titan must immediately move away from your Titan or risk taking damage from the electric smoke. If they won’t (or can’t) disembark, they must make a **Hard (<span class="difficulty">ddd</span>) Resilience check** or suffer 1 wound, plus 1 additional wound per <span class='symbols'>f</span>. If the Resilience check generates <span class='symbols'>hh</span>, they become Disoriented for two rounds. This cloud lasts until the end of your next turn. Any pilot that ends their turn in the smoke must make the Resilience check or suffer wound as described above.

Electric smoke comes equipped with 3 smoke canisters. 

\columnbreak

#### Particle Wall

The particle wall creates a concave force field which blocks all projectiles from one side and lets all projectiles through from the other. As an incidental you may deploy the particle wall in front of your Titan. It grants Ranged Defense 4 to everything behind the wall. It lasts until the end of your next turn, and it requires two rounds to recharge before it can be used again.

#### Vortex Shield
The Vortex Shield allows Titans to stop enemy fire such as rockets and bullets in their tracks and is able to send the projectiles right back to the enemy.

As an out-of-turn incidental you may deploy the vortex shield when targeted by a ranged combat check. It provides the Reflective 1 quality until the beginning of your next turn. If the triggering attack generates <span class='symbols'>hhh</span>, you may reflect the projectile (if any) back on the target, dealing the weapon’s base damage to the attacker. If the check generates <span class='symbols'>d</span>, you instead deal a Critical Injury (or a Critical Hit for vehicles).
